MEDI-GEM: AI-Powered Medical Appointment Platform

MEDI-GEM is a modern, feature-rich web application designed to streamline the patient-doctor appointment process. It features a sleek, glassmorphic dark-theme UI and leverages the power of NVIDIA's Nemotron for an AI-powered medical assistant chat. The platform supports distinct roles for Users (Patients), Doctors, and Admins, each with a tailored dashboard and specific permissions.

(Suggestion: Use a screen recorder like GIPHY Capture or LICEcap to create a GIF showcasing the user login, booking an appointment, and the doctor approving it. Replace the placeholder link above.)

üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

Prerequisites

Node.js & npm: Make sure you have Node.js (v18 or higher) and npm installed. You can download it here.

Firebase Account: You will need a Google account to create a Firebase project.

NVIDIA API Key: You need to get an API key for the Nemotron model from the NVIDIA API Catalog. You may need to join a waitlist.

1. Firebase Project Setup

Go to the Firebase Console.

Click "Add project" and give it a name (e.g., "medi-gem").

Once the project is created, navigate to the Project Overview page. Click the web icon (</>) to register a new web app.

Give the app a nickname and click "Register app".

Firebase will provide you with a firebaseConfig object. Copy this object. We will use it in the environment variables setup.

In the left sidebar, go to Build > Authentication. Click "Get started" and enable the Email/Password provider.

In the left sidebar, go to Build > Firestore Database. Click "Create database", start in Test mode, and choose a location.

Crucial Step: Manually set up the initial user roles.

Go to your Firestore Database and create a collection named users.

After you sign up your first few users in the app, their UIDs will appear in the Authentication tab.

Find the document in the users collection that corresponds to the user you want to be an admin. Edit that document and change the role field from "user" to "admin".

Do the same for another user to make them a doctor.

2. Installation & Environment Variables

Clone the repository:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less

git clone https://github.com/your-username/medi-gem.git
cd medi-gem

Frontend Setup:

Install dependencies:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
npm install

Create an environment file. In the root medi-gem directory, create a file named .env.local.

Paste your Firebase config into it, prefixed with VITE_:

code
.env
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
VITE_API_KEY="AIzaSy...YOUR_KEY...cqc"
VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN="med-gem-e7e83.firebaseapp.com"
VITE_PROJECT_ID="med-gem-e7e83"
VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET="med-gem-e7e83.appspot.com"
VITE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="963667494364"
VITE_APP_ID="1:96366...YOUR_ID...b19"

Backend AI Server Setup:

Navigate to the server directory and install dependencies:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
cd server
npm install

Create an environment file. In the server directory, create a file named .env.

Add your NVIDIA API key:

code
.env
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
NVIDIA_API_KEY="nvapi-YOUR_NVIDIA_API_KEY_HERE"

Important: Ensure .env.local and server/.env are listed in your .gitignore file to keep your secrets safe!

3. Running the Project

You must run both the frontend and backend servers simultaneously in separate terminal windows.

Start the Backend AI Server:

Open a terminal in the server directory.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
cd server
node server.js

You should see the output: MEDI-GEM AI server listening on http://localhost:3001

Start the Frontend Development Server:

Open a second terminal in the root medi-gem directory.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
npm run dev

Your application should now be running at http://localhost:5173.
