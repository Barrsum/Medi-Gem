# MEDI-GEM: AI-Powered Medical Appointment Platform

MEDI-GEM is a modern, feature-rich web application designed to streamline the patient-doctor appointment process. It features a sleek, glassmorphic dark-theme UI and leverages the power of NVIDIA's Nemotron for an AI-powered medical assistant chat. The platform supports distinct roles for Users (Patients), Doctors, and Admins, each with a tailored dashboard and specific permissions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js & npm:** Make sure you have Node.js (v18 or higher) and npm installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **Firebase Account:** You will need a Google account to create a Firebase project.
*   **NVIDIA API Key:** You need to get an API key for the Nemotron model from the [NVIDIA API Catalog](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/discover). You may need to join a waitlist.

### 1. Firebase Project Setup

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  Click **"Add project"** and give it a name (e.g., "medi-gem").
3.  Once the project is created, navigate to the **Project Overview** page. Click the web icon (`</>`) to register a new web app.
4.  Give the app a nickname and click **"Register app"**.
5.  Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` object. **Copy this object.** We will use it in the environment variables setup.
6.  In the left sidebar, go to **Build > Authentication**. Click **"Get started"** and enable the **Email/Password** provider.
7.  In the left sidebar, go to **Build > Firestore Database**. Click **"Create database"**, start in **Test mode**, and choose a location.
8.  **Crucial Step:** Manually set up the initial user roles.
    *   Go to your Firestore Database and create a collection named `users`.
    *   After you sign up your first few users in the app, their UIDs will appear in the Authentication tab.
    *   Find the document in the `users` collection that corresponds to the user you want to be an **admin**. Edit that document and change the `role` field from `"user"` to `"admin"`.
    *   Do the same for another user to make them a **doctor**.

### 2. Installation & Environment Variables

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/medi-gem.git
    cd medi-gem
    ```

2.  **Frontend Setup:**
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Create an environment file. In the root `medi-gem` directory, create a file named `.env.local`.
    *   Paste your Firebase config into it, prefixed with `VITE_`:
        ```.env
        VITE_API_KEY="AIzaSy...YOUR_KEY...cqc"
        VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN="med-gem-e7e83.firebaseapp.com"
        VITE_PROJECT_ID="med-gem-e7e83"
        VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET="med-gem-e7e83.appspot.com"
        VITE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="963667494364"
        VITE_APP_ID="1:96366...YOUR_ID...b19"
        ```

3.  **Backend AI Server Setup:**
    *   Navigate to the server directory and install dependencies:
        ```bash
        cd server
        npm install
        ```
    *   Create an environment file. In the `server` directory, create a file named `.env`.
    *   Add your NVIDIA API key:
        ```.env
        NVIDIA_API_KEY="nvapi-YOUR_NVIDIA_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```

4.  **Important:** Ensure `.env.local` and `server/.env` are listed in your `.gitignore` file to keep your secrets safe!

### 3. Running the Project

You must run both the frontend and backend servers simultaneously in separate terminal windows.

1.  **Start the Backend AI Server:**
    *   Open a terminal in the `server` directory.
    ```bash
    cd server
    node server.js
    ```
    *   You should see the output: `MEDI-GEM AI server listening on http://localhost:3001`

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    *   Open a second terminal in the **root** `medi-gem` directory.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    *   Your application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.
